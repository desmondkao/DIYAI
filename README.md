This is an LLM built for educational purposes which uses Tensorflow and Keras to elucidate how an LLM trains itself off of a corpus text. I used it to teach a workshop at Yale about to efficacy of training LLMs locally on one's own computer rather than relying on cloud computing based LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Gemini which are unsustainable.
